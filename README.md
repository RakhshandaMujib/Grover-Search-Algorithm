# Grover-Search-Algorithm
This repository includes the implementation of the generalized Grover's search algorithm for n qubits with M winning elements written in Qiskit. It uses the knowledge of matrices devised for the  phase oracle and the diffuser and outputs the probabilities of elements in the form of a histogram. <br />
For the curious, the original paper by L. Grover is also attached. You can click [here](https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-algorithms/grover.html) to study the implementation of the same for 2 and 3 qubits using the available quantum gates. <br />
Happy learning!
