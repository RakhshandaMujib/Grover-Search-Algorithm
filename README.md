# Grover-Search-Algorithm
This repository includes the implementation of the Grover's search algorithm for n qubits with M winning elements written in Qiskit. It uses the knowledge of matrices devised for the  phase oracle and the diffuser and outputs the probabilities of elements in the form of a histogram.
